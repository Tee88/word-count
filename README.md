## Task Description

In a programming/scripting language of your choice, create a script or app that downloads the webpage at http://www.randomtextgenerator.com and checks how many times the word "and" appears within the `<textarea id="generatedtext">` ... `</textarea>` element.

It should then create a new file at the path "C:\temp\and.txt" and write the contents of the `<textarea id="generatedtext">` element to the file, as well as the number of times the word "and" appears within it at the bottom of the file.
